Hello Readers,<br>
It is A mini Youtube App where we can get to search for the videos we want just like we used to do in Youtube. Here we can get the trending videos as soon as we entered into the homepage.

I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Youtube-API

Let us share my experience,<br>
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. there were some more functionalities that could have been done, the time didnâ€™t permit me to go further. But I will surely improve it during the course of time in future .

## So journey started from here!
